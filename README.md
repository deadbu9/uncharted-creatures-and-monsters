# uncharted-creatures-and-monsters

WARNING : 
Usage of this homebrew module is restricted of personal use without ant commercial intent due copyrighted token image
because finding cute stuff is easier to do rather than drawing it
If I do the drawing all the monster here will change type into abberation 
and that is not the intend of the module

PRECAUTION :
This homebrew is far from balanced
since the intent of the author is to make tactical battle with extra interractivity and mechanic
works well with this optional Rule : SHOWTIME , FLANKING , MOUNTING and BREAKAGE
position yourself, work together, climb enemy cut it's hand or tail
break it's armor, don't just attack and see subliminal number goes down
You are free to clone this REPO / Homebrew and edit it to suit your play/GM/style

HOW TO USE : 
coming soon
